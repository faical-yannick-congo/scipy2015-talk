This is the slides of the talk that i gave on SciPy 2015 about:
- Building a cloud service for reproducible simulation metada.
- I am working to make it accessible to all scientists to 
collaborate with other scientist around the results of your 
simulations improve the reproducibility of your results, 
access your results on the fly and build some workflows on top 
of the API that we are providing.
We definitely encourage you to check out Sumatra:
https://pythonhosted.org/Sumatra/
It's the simulation management tool that we are supporting currently.
We also support Docker as a container symstem and will probably add
Rocket.
